    "Default storage location for Anaconda when you open a terminal is `(base)`. Think of this as a virtual environment separate from your system wide Python for example. Here you do not have to worry about other installations of Python or packages having issues or conflicts because it is self contained. `BUT,DO NOT GO ABOUT INDIVIDUALLY UPDATE SEPARATE LIBRARIES FOR PROJECTS HERE`. This is the area where your application is stored and each environment you create to work in will be little files/folders containing your work with whatever dependencies and packages needed without affecting global installations. \n",
