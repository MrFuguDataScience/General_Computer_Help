    "    \n",
    "+ Your variables and workspace are limited by time as well as resources. You have a timeout of 12 hours. \n",
    "+ There is another side note: 90 minute idel timeout\n",
    "+ You have a disk usuage of 108GB with a max usable 77GB\n",
    "+ Ram and GPU are something to consider as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "# `Considerations for using Colab:`\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) Because you are limited on resources, big data can pose an issue.\n",
    "+ A work around is using Google Drive to import data but you are limited to 15GB for FREE, then you pay for storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) Free GPU use takes advantage of K80\n",
    "\n",
    "`Pro's:`\n",
    "+ No dependencies needed on your local device\n",
    "+ Free use and relatively easy startup\n",
    "+ Sharing your code with anyone\n",
    "+ Code can be written in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`Cons:`\n",
    "+ Free use of GPU or TPU (such as K80) is not the fasted. And the free version is rate limited based on ram, timing out for example. \n",
    "+ large data need to be stored in GCP or Google Drive\n",
    "+ There are obviously better options such as AWS "
