    "+ A few years ago from what I read around the time of `Catalina` Apple decided to move from *Bash* to *ZSH*. The usage is similar but security and licensing had to do with it from what I read (did not verify).\n",
    "+ If you came from an older Intel device that was not updated or deprecated/legacy hardware without Apple updates you would not have noticed this. Buying a new device now you will see the default shell as ZSH and yes you still have an option of Bash but to get a newer versio you should consider Homebrew to enable if that is your interest.\n",
