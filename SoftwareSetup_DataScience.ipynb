    "\n",
    "The installation steps are outlined here but may seem confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) **Download the file and unzip if needed**\n",
    "\n",
    "+ `tar -zxvf file_name_folder`\n",
    "+ Now, in terminal `cd /Downloads`\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) **Manage Binaries:** \n",
    "\n",
    "+ We need to take this folder of MongoDB that was downloaded and send it to the `home directory` we are working with.\n",
    "    + If you are in the terminal by default: `pwd` and this will print the home directory for you, it may have a tilde i nthe prompt name before the command.\n",
    "+ Then we will make a folder to store this download unless you want to move directly\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo mv yourMongoFileName locationHomeFoler` -> `sudo namefile /User/yourUserName`\n",
    "\n",
    "or \n",
    "\n",
    "the default area mac would store 3rd party apps: `sudo mv yourMongoFolder /usr/local` and if you want you can add a folder prefixed with mongodb as a reference like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ `cd /usr/local`\n",
    "+ `mkdir mongodb`\n",
    "+ then `sudo mv yourMongoFolder /usr/local/mongodb`\n",
    "\n",
    "+ If you do not have the bin folder later, when you encounter: `/usr/local/bin` you will need to create or delete what looks like a folder buy may be a file. More on this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) Set the path for MongoDB binaries to allow `mongod` command to be in PATH:\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be found in your bash or zsh file. I am using Zsh, so the variable we need to bind will be in the `.zshrc` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Vim in the terminal: \n",
    "\n",
    "+ you can find the `.zshrc` file if we are in the home folder of terminal `Users/yourusername` is what I am describing\n",
    "+ use command: `ls -al` to look for this file `.zshrc` if it exists good.\n",
    "    + If not create it using `touch .zshrc` and save it.\n",
    "+ Then you will need to use this file to store the variables to connect our binaries\n",
    "    + open file with your text editor, i am using vim: `vim .zshrc`\n",
    "    + inside vim press *i* for insert and type this: `export PATH=\"/usr/local/mongodb/bin:$PATH\"` or `export PATH=\"/User/yourusernamehere/mongodb/bin:$PATH\"`\n",
    "    + to exit vim: `:wq` to save and quit\n",
    "    + then to acitivate your new setting: `source .zshrc` or restart terminal and run command `mongod`\n",
    "        + You will see it trying to work but needs a connection to the db path that was not setup yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) **Create Data/db Folder(s)** you can do this in 1 step instead of 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ This is used to *let MongoDB know where to write data*.\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo mkdir -p data/db`\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending where you want to install this be in correct and consistent location in terminal: `Users/yourusername` or `/usr/local`\n",
    "\n",
    "4.) We need the data to be in the path of mongod now: make sure you are in the path of where MONGO is stored during setup\n",
    "such as home directory: `Users/youruserName` or `/usr/local` before you run this command to bind them.\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo mongod --dbpath=/Users/yourusername/data/db` or `sudo mongod --dbpath=/usr/local/yourmongoDBNameHere/data/db`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5.) **Create Log Folder** to store/redirect our log reports, which can be helpful for troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo mkdir -p logs`\n",
    "\n",
    "6.) **Next, where to send log reports:** \n",
    "\n",
    "`./mongod --dbpath /usr/local/mongodb/your/data/db > /usr/local/mongodb/mongodb-macos-x86_64-5.0.14/logs/mongod.log 2>&1 &`\n",

    "\n",
    "And change this to your version: *mongodb-macos-x86_64-5.0.14*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will need the `Mongosh` or `GUI` this will be used to connect the `server` running `MongoDB` from the command `mongod` that was used to initiate the server. But, you need a way to interact with the server/client. The old way was to use `mongo` but this was depricated and `mongosh` is used now. In order to use this command we need to do another download and create a path for the binaries again.\n",
